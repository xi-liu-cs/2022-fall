given a sequence {x_n} write 'formal object'
sum_{n = 1} ^ {infty} x_n
sum x_n
{x_n} is a formal object
call it series
converges if sequence partial sums {s_k}
s_k := sum_{n = 1} ^ k x_n converges
abuse notation

if converge
sum_{n = 1} ^ {infty} x_n = lim_{k -> inf} s_k
if {s_k} diverges, sum x_n diverges

convergence of geometric sequence
suppose -1 < r < 1
then series sum_{n = 1} ^ {infty} r ^ n converges to 1 / (1 - r)

proof
define s_k = sum_{n = 0} ^ {k - 1} x_n = 1 + r ^ 1 + ... + r ^ {k - 1}
r - s_k = r + r ^ 2 + ... + r ^ k
s_k - r * s_k = (1 - r)s_k = 1 + r ^ 1 + r ^ 2 + ... + r ^ {k - 1} - (1 + r ^ 2 + ... + r ^ k) = 1 - r ^ k
s_k = (1 - r ^ k) / (1 - r) = 1 / (1 - r) - 1 / (1 - r) * r ^ k
lim_{k -> inf} s_k = 1 / (1 - r)

since {s_k} converges
sum x_n converges to 1 / (1 - r)

cannot assume sum_{n = 0} ^ infty r ^ n = s is a real number
rs = r + r ^ 2 + r ^ 3 + ...
s - rs = (1 - r)s = 1, s = 1 / (1 - r)

plot x vs f(x)
as x approachs c

cluster point
to say f(x) -> L as x -> c
first need to figure out conditions to allow x to approach c
let S subset R be a set
say a number c in R is called a cluster point of s if
for all delta > 0, exists x in S \ {c}, |x - c| < delta
(c - delta, c + delta) cap S \ {c} is non empty

c in R is not a cluter point of S
exists delta > 0, for all x in S \ {c}, |x - c| >= delta
(c - delta, c + delta) cap S \ {c} is empty

S = {0} cup [1, 2]
plot
delta is a width
0 in R is not a cluster point of S
exists delta = 1 / 2, (c - delta, c + delta)
= (0 - delta, 0 + delta) cap S \ {0}
= (-1 / 2, 1 / 2) cap [1, 2]
= empty set

c is isolated from other points of S

claim 1 in R is a cluster point of S
for all delta > 0
if delta < 1
(c - delta, c + delta) = (1 - delta, 1 + delta) 
= {0} cup (1, 2]
is non empty
1 is cluster point

sequential characterization of cluster points
let S subset R
then c in R is a cluster point of S
iff exists a convergent sequence {x_n}
x_n in S \ {c} for all n in N
lim x_n = c
c is cluster point iff x -> c without being equal to c

assume c in R is a cluster point of S
(c - 1 / n, c + 1 / n) cap S \ {c} is non empty for all n in N
take x_n in (c - 1 / n, c + 1 / n) cap S \ {c}
x_n in S \ {c} /* since cap */
let e > 0 be arbitrary
take M in N, 1 / M < e
for all n >= M
/* x_n in (c - 1 / n, c + 1 / n), c - 1 / n < x_n < c + 1 / n, |x_n - c| < 1 / n */
|x_n - c| <= 1 / n <= 1 / M < e
{x_n} converge to c

assume {x_n} converges to c in R with x_n in S \ {c} for all n in N
let d > 0 be arbitrary, since x_n converge to c
exists M in N, for all n >= M, |x_n - c| < d (set epsilon := delta)
-> x_m in (c - d, c + d)
and x_m in S \ {c}
so x_m in (c - d, c + d) cap S \ {c}
so set (c - d, c + d) cap S \ {c} is non empty
so c is cluster point

limit of a function
epsilon delta definition of limit of a function
let f: S -> R be a function
c in R be a cluster point of S subset R
suppose exists L in R, for all e > 0, exists d > 0,
whenever x in S \ {c} and |x - c| < d, we have
|f(x) - L| < e
then f(x) converges to limit L as x goes to c
lim_{x -> c} f(x) = L
f(x) -> L as x -> c
if no such L exists, f(x) diverges as x -> c

f(x) converges as x -> c
exists L in R, for all e > 0, exists d > 0, for all x in (c - d, c + d) cap S \ {c} /* always non empty since c is a cluster point */
|f(x) - L| < e
{x_n} converges as n -> infty
compare with
exists L in R, for all e > 0, exists n in N, |x_n - L| < e

plot x vs f(x), S = R
f(x) -> L as x -> c
draw x = c, y = L
draw x: (c - d, c + d)
draw y: (L - e, L + e)

f: [0, 1] -> R
given by f(x) = 
{
x if 0 < x <= 1
1 if x = 0
}
lim_{x -> 0} f(x) = 0

let e > 0 be arbitrary, exists d = e, then
for all x in (0 - d, 0 + d) cap S \ {0}
|x - 0| < d and x in [0, 1] \ {0} = (0, 1]
|f(x) - L| = |x - 0| < d = e
