S subset R, c in R is a cluster point of S
for all d > 0, (c - e, e + e) cap S \ {c} is non empty

exists L in R, for all e > 0, exists d > 0, for all x in (c - d, c + d) cap S \ {c} /* always non empty since c is a cluster point */
|f(x) - L| < e

sequential limit
let S subset R, c be a cluster point of S
f: S -> R
f(x) -> L as x -> c iff for all sequence
{x_n} satistfy x_n in S \ {c} for all n in N, lim_{n -> infty} x_n = c
we have sequence {f(x)} converges to L

lim f(x) = L
lim f(x_n) = L for all x_n

assume lim_{x -> c} f(x) = L
for all e > 0, exists d > 0, for all x in (c - d, c + d) cap S \ {c} |f(x) - L| < e
for all sequence {x_n} satisfying  x_n in S \ {c} for all n in N, lim_{n -> infty} x_n = c
exists M in N, for all n >= M, |x_n - c| < d, note x_n in (c - d, c + d) cap S \ {c}
for all n >= M
|f(x_n) - L| < e
{f(x_n)} converges to L

contrapositive
show f(x) not converge to L as x -> c 
imply
{x_n} in S \ {c} for all n in N, x_n -> c as n -> infty, f(x_n) not converge to L as n -> infty

f(x) not converge to L:
exits e > 0, for all d > 0, exists x in (c - d, c + d) cap S \ {c}
|f(x) - L| >= e

assume f(x) not converge to L as x -> c
exits e > 0, for all n in N, exists x_n in S \ {c} cap (c - 1 / n, c + 1 / n)
|f(x_n) - L| >= e

x_n in S \ {c} for all n in N
|x_n - c| <= 1 / n
|f(x) - L| >= e > 0 /* e is a fixed number */
since at least e, f(x_n) not converge to L as n -> infty

f: R \ {0} -> R
f(x) = sin(1 / x)
claim f(x) diverges as x -> 0

suppose lim_{x -> c} f(x) = L in R as x -> 0
by sequential limit lemma
for all x_n satisfy x_n in R \ {0}, x_n -> 0 as n -> inf
lim f(x_n) = L

take x_n given by x_n = 1 / (n pi + pi / 2)
x_n -> 0 as n -> infty
x_n in R \ {0}
f(x_n) = sin(1 / x_n) = sin(1 / (1 / (n pi + pi / 2))) = sin((n pi + pi / 2) = (-1) ^ n not converge to L as n -> infty
vontradiction, f(x) not converge to any L as x -> 0

upgrade results about sequences to functions
continuity of mul
f(x) -> L1
g(x) -> L2
as x -> c
forall {x_n} satisfy  x_n in S \ {0} for all n in N, x_n -> 0 as n -> inf
lim (f * g) /* converge by sequential limit lemma */
= (lim f)(lim g) /* continuity og mul of sequences */
= L1 * L2
/* change input from x_n (sequence) to x (function) */

why S \ {c}
limit of sequence, cannot plug in n = infty
limit of function, cannot plug in x = c
lim_{n -> 0} (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h

continuity
e-d definition of continuity
S subset R, c in S, f: S -> R
f is continuous at c if
for all e > 0, exists d > 0, for all x in S, |x - c| < d
|f(x) - f(c)| < e
if f is continuous for all c in S, f is continuous function

characterizations of continuity
let S subset R, c in S, f: S -> R

limit characterization:
if(c != cluster of S)
  f is continuous at c
if(c == cluster of S)
  f is continuous at c iff lim_{x -> c} f(x) = f(c)

sequential characterization
f is continuous at c iff for all sequence {x_n} satisfying
x_n in S, for all n in N and x_n -> c as n -> infty
lim_{n -> infty} f(x_n) = f(c) = f(lim_{n -> infty} x_n)

proof limit characterization
1. suppose c is not cluster point of S
not cluster: 
exists d > 0, (c - d, c + d) cap S \ {c} is empty
since c in S, (c - d, c + d) cap S = {c}
for all e > 0, for d above, for all x in S, |x - c| < d
for all x in {c}
|f(x)| - f(c)| = |f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < e
so f is continuous

2. let c be cluster point of S
assume f is continuous at c
for all e > 0, exists d > 0, for all x in (c - d, c + d) cap S, |f(x) - f(c)| < e /* more strict */
note (c - d, c + d) cap S \ {c} subset (c - d, c + d) cap S
for all e > 0, exists d > 0, for all x in (c - d, c + d) cap S \ {c}, |f(x) - f(c)| < e /* less strict */
lim_{x -> c} f(x) = f(c)

proof sequential characterization
assume lim_{x -> c} f(x) = f(c)
for all e > 0, exists d > 0,  for all x in S \ {c} cap (c - d, c + d), |f(x) - f(c)| < e
note |f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < e, for all x in S cap (c - d, c + d)
f is continuous at c
