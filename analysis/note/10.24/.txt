continuous f: [a, b] -> R is bounded
min max theorem
bolzano mean value theorem

min max
a function f: S -> R achieves an absolute maximum
if exists c in S, for all x in S, f(x) <= f(c)

a function f: S -> R achieves an absolute minimum
if exists c in S, for all x in S, f(x) >= f(c)

f: R -> R
f(x) = 1 / (x ^ 2 + 1)

a continuous function f: [a, b] -> R
achieves both an absolute max and absolute min
on closed and bounded interval [a, b] subset R

shown f: [a, b] -> R is bounded
set f([a, b]) = {f(x): x in [a, b]} is bounded
so it has a sup/inf

exists sequences {f(x_n)} {f(y_n)} which approach sup inf
for all n in N, exists f(x_n) in f([a, b])
sup f([a, b]) - 1 / n < f(x_n) < sup f([a, b])
f(x_n) -> sup f([a, b]) as n -> infty

sequences {x_n}, {y_n} are bounded
for all n in N
a <= x_n <= b
a <= y_n <= b
by bolzano
exists convergent subsequences {x_{n_k}}, {y_{m_k}}

define c := lim_{k -> infty} x_{n_k}
d := lim_{k -> infty} y_{m_k}
limit preserve <=
a <= c <= b
a <= d <= b

f is continuous
by sequential characterization
sup f([a, b]) = lim_{n -> infty} f(x_n) construction of {f(x_n)}
=  lim_{k -> infty} f(x_n_k) subsequence of convergent sequence
= f(lim_{k -> infty} x_{n_k}) {x_{n_k}} is convergent to some c in [a, b]
= f(c)
f(c) = sup f([a, b]) >= f(x)
f achieves an absolute max at c in [a, b]

domain of f matter
f: R -> R
f(x) := x
f has no max min (unbounded)
f|_{[a, b]} [a, b] -> R and continuity -> boundedness

candidate sup f([a, b]), inf f([a, b])

domain must bounded
f(x_n) -> sup f[a, b]
if bounded, can extract convergent subsequence by bolzano

domain must closed
limit preserve <=
for all k in N, x_{n_k} <= b
lim_{k -> infty} x_{n_k} <= b

f: (0, 1) -> R
f(x) := 1 / x
f has no upper bound
no absolute max
for all x in (0, 1), f(x) >= 1
f(1) is not defined
f has no absolute min

bolzano intermediate value theorem
lemma (bisection method for root finding)
f: [a, b] -> R be a continuous function
suppose f(a) < 0 < f(b)
then exists c in (a, b)
such that f(c) = 0

prove by algorithm
bisection method
1. construct a bisecting sequence of intervals [a_n, b_n]
start search in [a1, b1]
look at middle 
check (a1 + b1) / 2
2. show convergence of {a_n}, {b_n}
3. compute limit c in (a, b)
4. show f(c) = 0

1. construct sequences {a_n}, {b_n} inductively
base step: take a1 := a, b1 := b
a1 < b1, b1 - a1 = 1 / (2 ^ 0)(b - a)
inductive step: assume a_n, b_n have been defined
a_n < b_n, b_n - a_n = 1 / (2 ^ {n - 1})(b - a)

a_n < b_n -> a_n < (a_n + b_n) / 2 < b_n
b_{n + 1} - a_{n + 1} = (b_n - a_n) / 2
computation prove by cases

a_n < b_n, for all n in N
prove interval is shrinking
a_{n + 1} >= a_n
b_{n + 1} <= b_n
for all n in N
they are monotone
