bisection method for root finding
f: [a, b] -> R be continuous
suppose f(a) < 0 < f(b)
then exists c in (a, b)
such that f(c) = 0

construct sequences {a_n}, {b_n} inductively
such that
1. for all n in N, a_n < b_n, valid interval [a_n, b_n]
2. for all n in N, a_n <= a_{n + 1}, b_{n + 1} <= b_n, monotone
3. b_n - a_n = 1 / 2 ^ {n - 1}(b - a) intervals are bisecting
4. for all n in N, f(a_n) < 0 <= f(b_n) endpoints crossing 0

for all n in N
a_1 <= a_n <= b_n <= b_1
{a_n}, {b_n} are bounded monotone sequences, so they converge

since {a_n}, {b_n} converge
lim_{n -> infty} (b_n - a_n)
= lim_{n -> infty} 1 / 2 ^ {n - 1}(b - a) = 0
lim a_n = lim b_n := c

since a = a_1 <= a_n <= b_n <= b_1
limit preserve non strict inequality
a <= c <= b

from 4.
f(a_n) < 0
by continuity of f
f(c) = f(lim_{n -> infty} a_n)
= lim_{n -> infty} f(a_n)
<= 0

f(b_n) >= 0
by continuity of f
f(c) = f(lim_{n -> infty} b_n)
= lim_{n -> infty} f(b_n)
>= 0

f(c) <= 0, f(c) >= 0, f(c) = 0
c != a, c != b
a < c < b

bolzano intermediate value theorem
f: [a, b] -> R be continuous
suppose y in R
satisfies f(a) < y < f(b)
or f(a) > y > f(b)
then exists c in (a, b)
f(c) = y

consider 2 cases
if f(a) < y < f(b)
define g: [a, b] -> R
g(x) := f(x) - y
g(a) := f(a) - y < 0 < g(b) = f(b) - y
g is continuous
by bisection method
exists c in (a, b)
g(c) = f(c) - y = 0
f(c) = y

every polynomial of odd degree has a real root
f be a polynomial of odd degree
f(x) = sum a_d x_d, d in N is odd

can take
lim_{n -> infty} (b_{d - 1} n ^ {d - 1} + ... + b_0) / n ^ d
= lim 1 / n = 0

exists M in n
for all n >= M
-1 < b ... n / n ^ d < 1

g|[-K, M]: [-K, M] -> R is continuous
g(-K) < 0 < g(M)
by bolzano intermediate value theorem
exists some c in [-K, M] such that g(c) = 0

I subset R be an interval
let f: I -> R
c in I
if limit L := lim_{x -> c} (f(x) - f(c)) / (x - c) difference quotient
if L exists, then f is differentiable at c
f'(c) := L

if f is differentiable for all c in I
we say f is differentiable
f': I -> R as derivative

f(x) = x ^ 2 is differentiable
let c in R be arbitrary
for x != c

let f: I -> R be differentiable at some c in I
then f is continuous at c

let f, c be as given
since f is diff at c
lim_{x -> c} f(x) - f(c) / x - c = f'(c)

let I1, I2 be intervals
g: I1 -> I2 be differentiable at c in I1
g: I2 -> R be differentiable at g(c) in I2
