d := g(c) in I2
define u: I2 -> R, v: I1 -> I2 by
u(y) =
{
  f(y) - d / y - d if y != d
  f'(d) if y = d
}

lim_{y -> d} u(y) = u(d)
u is continuous at d

lim_{x -> c} v(x) = g(c)
v is continuous at c

for any y in I2, x in I1
f(y) - f(d) = u(y)(y - d)

h(x) - h(c) = f(g(x)) - f(g(c))
u(g(x))(g(x) - g(c)) // use 1 with y = g(x), d = g(c)

(g(x) - g(c)) / (x - c) = u(g(x)) v(x)
lim_{x -> c}(g(x) - g(c)) / (x - c) = lim_{x -> c} u(g(x)) v(x)
= u(g(c)) v(c)

let S subset R, f: S -> R
f has relative max if exists d > 0, for all x in S
|x - c| < d, f(c) >= f(x)

relative min/max f(c) -> critical point f'(c) = 0
suppose f: [a, b] -> R is differentiable at c in (a, b)
suppose f has a relative min/max at c
then f'(c) = 0

f(c) is a relative max
rel min follows by consider -f

assume f(c) is a relative max
exists d > 0
forall x in [a, b]
|x - c| < d
f(c) >= f(x)

diff quotient in 2 cases
x in (c, c + d)
then
(f(x) - f(c)) / (x - c)
x - c > 0
f(x) - f(c) <= 0
so (f(x) - f(c)) / (x - c) <= 0

x in (c - d, c)
x - c < 0
so (f(x) - f(c)) / (x - c) >= 0

take sequences {x_n}, {y_n}
satisfying x_n in (c, c + d)
y_n in (c - d, c)
take d small enough

x_n -> c as n -> infty
by sequential limit lemma
f'(c) = lim f(x_n) - f(c) / x_n - c <= 0, since limit preserve <=

rolle's theorem
let f:[a, b] -> R be a continuous function
differentiable on (a, b)
f(a) = f(b)
then exists c in (a, b)
f'(c) = 0

f: [-1, 1] -> R
f = sqrt{1 - x ^ 2}

by min/max theorem
since f is continuous on [a, b]
it achieves a min/max
let k = f(a) = f(b)
1. suppose exist x in (a, b)
if f(c) is absolute max
f(c) > f(x) > k
-> c in (a, b)

zero derivative -> constant function
let I be an interval and f: I -> R be a differentiable function
suppose f'(x) = 0 for all x in I, then f is constant
f|_[x, y] is continuous and differentiable
thus, f|_[x, y] satisfies maen value theorem
exists c in (x, y) satisfying
