existence of convergent subsequences
if {x_n} is a bounded sequence, then exists a subsequence {x_n_k} satisfying
lim_{k -> inf} x_n_k = lim_{n -> inf} sup x_n (always exists)

similarly, exists a possibly different subsequence
{x_m_k}, lim_{k -> inf} x_m_k = lim_{n -> inf} inf x_n

construct a subsequence inductively
base case: set n1 = 1 (x1 is first element {x_n_k})
inductive step: n_p is defined
a_n := sup{x_k : k >= n}
lim a_n = lim sup x_n

lim a_n_{p + 1} = sup{x_k : k >= n_p + 1} = n_p tail of {x_n}
since a_n_{p + 1} is a supremum, exists x_m in {x_k : k >= n_p + 1} such that
a_{n_{p} + 1} - 1 / (p + 1) < x_m <= a_n_{p + 1}

set n_{p + 1} = m > n_p
by induction, constructed a subsequence {x_n_k}

show {x_n_k} converges to lim sup x_n
a_{n_{k} + 1} - 1 / (k + 1) < x_{n_{k + 1}} < a_{n_k + 1} /* subsequence of {a_n}, converge to lim sup x_n */
lim sup x_n < x_{n_{k + 1}} < a_{n_k + 1}
squeeze lemma says that x_{n_{k + 1}} converges to lim sup x_n

1-tail of {x_n_k} converges to lim sup x_n
{x_n_k} converges to lim sup x_n

case for {x_m_k} converging to lim inf is similar

lim sup inf convergence test
let {x_n} be a bounded sequence, then {x_n} converges 
iff lim sup x_n = lim inf x_n
if {x_n} converges, lim x_n = lim sup x_n = lim inf x_n

prove
convergent -> lim sup = lim inf
assume {x_n} is convergent to some x := lim x_n, then
every subsequence converges to x
by theorem 2.3.4
there exists subsequence x_n_k and x_m_k which converge to lim sup and lim inf
lim sup x_n = lim x_n_k = x
lim inf x_n = lim x_m_k = x

lim sup x_n -> lim inf x_n
a_n := sup{x_k : k >= n} -> lim sup x_n
b_n := sup{x_k : k >= n} -> lim inf x_n
a_n <= k <= b_n, for all n in N
squeeze lemma
lim x_n = lim sup x_n = lim inf x_n

bolzano weierstrass
suppose {x_n} is a bounded sequence of real numbers
then {x_n} has a convergent subsequence {x_n_k}
follow from (theorem 2.3.4 (only hold for R))
bolzano weierstrass generalizes to R ^ n

a sequence {x_n} is a cauchy sequence if
for all e > 0, exists M in N, for all n, k >= M, |x_n - x_k| < e

{x_n} is convergent <-> exists L in R, for all e > 0, exists M in N, for all n >= M, |x_n - L| < e
{x_n} is cauchy <-> for all e > 0, exists M in N, for all n, k >= M, |x_n - x_k| < e
do not need a candidate limit L here

cauchy completeness of R
a sequence of real numbers is cauchy iff it is convergent
R dedekind complete
<-> R has least upper bound property
<-> sup{x_n * k >= n} always exists
<-> lim inf/sup
<-> cauchy completeness

for all e > 0, exists M in N, for all n, k >= M, |x_n - x_k| < e
plot n vs x_n

if {x_n} is cauchy, then it is bounded
suppose {x_n} is cauchy
-> exists M in N, for all n, k >= M, |x_n - x_k| < e = 1
-> for all n >= M, |x_n| - |x_M| <= ||x_n| - |x_M|| <= |x_n - x_M| /* reverse triangle */
-> plug in k = M, |x_n - x_M|
-> |x_n| <= 1 + |x_M|, for all n >= M
set B := max{|x_1|, |x_2|, ..., |x_{M - 1}|, 1 + |x_M|} /* n < M, n >= M */
|x_n| <= B, for all n in N, so {x_n} bounded

cauchy completeness of R
(cauchy <- convergent)
assume {x_n} is convergent to L in R
let e > 0 be arbitrary
exists M in N, for all n >= M, |x_n - L| < e / 2
for all n, k >= M
|x_n - x_k| = |x_n - L + L - x_k| <= |x_n - L| + |x_k - L| < e / 2 + e / 2 = e

(cauchy -> convergent)
assume {x_n} is cauchy
implies x_n is bounded
by theorem 2.3.4
exists subsequences {x_n_k} and {x_m_k} which converge to lim sup/inf
let a := lim sup x_n = lim x_n_k
b := lim inf x_n = lim x_m_k
let e > 0 be arbitrary
exists M1 in N, for all n, k >= M, |x_n - x_k| < e / 3 /* cauchy */
exists M2 in N, for all k >= M, |x_n_k - a| < e / 3 /* x_n_k -> a */
exists M3 in N, for all k >= M, |x_m_k - b| < e / 3 /* x_m_k -> b */
M := max(M!, M2, M3), n_k, m_k >= k >= m
for all k >= M
|a - b| = |a - x_n_k + x_n_k - x_m_k + x_m_k - b|
<= |a - x_n_k| + |x_n_k - x_m_k| + |x_m_k - b|
< e / 3 + e / 3 + e / 3 = e
|a - b| < e, for all e > 0 
a = b
lim sup x_n = lim sup x_n
{x_n} converge
