a bounded function f: [a, c] -> R is riemann integrable iff
f in R[a, b] and f in R[b, c] is riemann integrable on subintervals

assume f in R[a, b] and f in R[b, c]
underline{int_a ^ b} f = overline{int_a ^ b} f
underline{int_b ^ c} f = overline{int_b ^ c} f

refined forms of continuity
differentiability vs continuity

uniform continuity
lipschitz continuity

let S subset R, f: S -> R
|f(x) - f(y)| < e

lipschitz continuous
f is continuous at c in S: for all e > 0, exists d > 0, for all x in S, |x - c| < d, |f(x) - f(c)| < e
f is uniformly continuous, for all e > 0, exists d > 0, for all x, y in S, |x - y| < d, |f(x) - f(y)| < e

let f: (0, 1) -> R, f(x) = 1 / x
f is continuous, not uniformly continuous
for general S subset R
continuity not-> uniform

negate of uniform
exists e > 0, forall d > 0, exists x, y in S, |x - y| < d, |f(x) - f(y)| >= e

hierarchy of continuity
S subset R, f: S -> R, c in S
f is differentiable at c -> f is continuous at c

differentiable + bounded -> lipschitz -> uniform -> continuous

I = [a, b]
f' -> bounded f'

f: R -> R
f(x) = |x|
f is lipschitz continuous
not differentiable at x = 0
if f is lipschitz, |f(x) - f(y) / x - y| <= K
