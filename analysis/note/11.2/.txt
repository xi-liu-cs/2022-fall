sign of derivative vs increasing (decreasing)
let I subset R be an interval
f: I -> R be differentiable
1. f is increasing iff f'(x) >= 0 for all x in I
f is increasing, x > y -> f(x) >= f(y)
2. if f'(y) > 0, f is strictly increasing
x > y -> f(x) > f(y)

proof
suppose f is inc, differentiable
c, x in I, c != x
if x > c
  f(x) > f(c)
if x < c
  f(x) < f(c)
for all x in I with x != c
(f(x) - f(c)) / (x - c) >= 0
limit_{x -> c} (f(x) - f(c)) / (x - c) = f'(c) >= 0

suppose f'(x) >= 0 for all x in I
take arbitrary x, y in I with x < y
by mean value theorem
f|_[x, y] is continuous and differentiable
exists c in (x, y) such that 
f'(c) = (f(y) - f(x)) / (y - x)

f(y) = f(x) + f'(c)(y - x)

2 cases
f'(x) >= 0, for all x in I
f(y) = f(x) + f'(c)(y - x) = f(x) + (>= 0)(> 0) >= f(x)

f'(x) > 0, for all x in I
f(y) > f(x)

f strictly increasing not-> f'(x) > 0 for all x in I
f(x) = x ^ 3, x > y -> x ^ 3 > y ^ 3
f'(0) = 3(0) ^ 2 = 0 !> 0

if I -> R is differentiable
this defines f': I -> R called first derivative of f
if f': I -> R is also differentiable
this defines f'': I -> R
f is n times differentiable

for an n times differentiable function f: I -> R
with x_0 in interior of I ((a, b) subset I)
define nth order taylor poly for f at x_0 as
p_n ^ {x_0}(x) = sum_{k = 0} ^ n (f ^ (k)(x)) / k! (x - x_0) ^ k, n in N, n != infty

f(x) = taylor poly + lagrange form of remainder form
1. f(x) = taylor poly + O((x - x_0) ^ {n + 1})
can approximate f by taylor poly
2. exists some solution c which depends on value x, x_0, f, f', ..., f ^ {n - 1}
f ^ {n + 1}(c) / (n + 1)! = f(x) - p ^ {x_0}_n(x) / (x - x_0) ^ {n + 1}

f: [a, b] -> R
x, x_0 in [a, b] f is differentiable
f|_[x, x_0] assume x_0 > x
mvt says exists c in (x, x_0)
such that f'(c) = f(x) - f(x_0) / x - x_0
-> f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(c)(x - x_0)
equation of line going through (x_0, f(x_0))

c = c(x, x_0, f, f')

define M := (f(x) - P_{n} ^ {x_0}(x)) / (x - x_0) ^ {n + 1}
are all given, fixed, so M is a constant

find c
f ^ {n + 1}(c) / (n + 1)! = M

g(s) := f(s) - P_{n} ^ {x_0}(s)) - M(s - x_0) ^ {n + 1}
x, x_0 are fixed, s is var

compute derivatives of g
g ^ (k)(s) = f ^ (k)(s) - (P_{n} ^ {x_0}) ^ {k})(s) - Mk!(s - x_0) ^ {n + 1 - K} /* power rule */
plug in s = x_0
0 = g(x_0)
since (p_n ^ x_0) ^ (k)(x_0) = f ^ (k)(x_0)

g(x) = g(x_0) = 0
by mean value theorem
exists x_1 strictly between x and x_0
satisfying g'(x_1) = (g(x) - g(x_0)) / (x - x_0) = 0

repeat n times
g ^ (n)(x_n) = g ^ (n)(x_0) = 0
g ^ (n + 1)(x_(n + 1)) =  (g ^ (n)(x_n) - g ^ (n)(x_0)) / (x_n - x_0) = 0

let c := x_{n + 1}
c is strictly between x and x_0
g ^ (n + 1)(c) = f ^ (n + 1)(c) - 0 - M(n + 1)! /* since taylor is n order derivative */
M = (f ^ (n + 1)(c)) / (n + 1)!

f: [-1, 1] -> R
f(x) = sin x

sin x \approx x - x ^ 3 / 3 + O(x ^ 4)
by taylor theorem
for all x in [-1, 1]
x_0 = 0
exists c between x and 0
satisfying 
sin x = x - x ^ 3 / 3! + sin(c) x ^ 4 / 4!

|sin c| <= 1
|sin x - (x - x ^ 3 / 3!)| = |sin(c) x ^ 4 / 4!| = |sin c||x ^ 4| / 4! = |x| ^ 4 / 4!
f(x) - approx

2nd derivative test
suppose f: (a, b) -> R is twice continuously differentiable
suppose exists x_0 in (a, b) s.t. f'(x_0) = 0
f''(x_0) > 0
then f will have a strict rel min at x_0

since f''(a, b) -> R is continuous and f''(x_0) > 0
exists d > 0: f''(x) > 0 for all x in (x - d, x + d)
take arbitrary x in (x - d, x + d) with x != x_0
strict rel min , x_0 in S, for all x in (x - d, x + d) with x in S, f(x_0) < f(x)

by taylor's theorem
exists c between x, x_0
f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(c)(x - x_0) /* first order taylor */ + f''(c) / 2(x - x_0) ^ 2

f'(x_)) = 0 by assumption
(x - x_0) ^ 2 > 0 since x != x_0
f''(c) > 0
