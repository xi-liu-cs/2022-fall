tilde{P} superset P
tilde{P} is a refinement
let f: [a, b] -> R be a bounded function, underline_{int_a ^ b} f <= overline_{int_a ^ b} f
showed in prop 5.1.2
for any parition P
L(P, f) <= U(P, f)

let P_1, P_2 be arbitrary partitions of [a, b]
P = P1 cup P2
P superset p1
p superset p2
p is refinement of both
L(P_1, f) <= L(P, f) <= U(p, f) <= u(P2, f)
as the glb
overline{int_a ^ b} f = inf{U(p2, f), for all p2} >= L(P1, f)

when f in R[a, b]
underline int ~ lim inf
overline int ~ lim sup
{x_n} is convergent <-> lim inf x_n = lim sup x_n
f is riemann integrable <-> underline int = overline int

prop 5.1.13 upgrade
let f be bounded function
riemann integrals are like limits

f in R[a, b]
underline{int_a ^ b} f = sup L
= overline{int_a ^ b} f = inf U
exists P1 of [a, b]: int_a ^ b f - e / 2 < L(P1, f) <= int_a ^ b f
exists P2 of [a, b]: int_a ^ b f < U(P2, f) <= int_a ^ b f + e / 2

L(q, f) <= L(p, f) = L(p1, f) + L(p2, f)
{P = Q cup {b}: for all Q} subset {Q: for all Q}
a partition containing a point b is a subset of all partitions
