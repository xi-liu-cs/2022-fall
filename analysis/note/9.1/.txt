X = Y
x in X iff y in Y
X subset Y and Y subset X

map
f: X -> Y
x |-> f(x)
for all x in X
associate it with a unique element in Y
denoted as f(x)

f: X -> Y
A subset X
f(A) = {f(A): X in A}
f(B) ^ {-1} = {x in X: f(X) in B}

def X -> Y
1. f is 1 - 1
2. f is onto, f(X) = Y
3. f is bijective

exists t in R s.t. e ^ t = t + 2
f(t) = e ^ t - t - 2
f(0) < 0, f(100) > 0
-> exists f(t) = 0

exists t in R s.t. t ^ 3 = 2
1. exist (intermediate)
2. onto

f: X -> Y
if exists g, Y -> X s.t.
f * g = id(y)
g * f = id(x)
f is bijective
f ^ {-1} = g

show bijective
1. 1 - 1
f(x1) = f(x2) -> x1 = x2
g(f(x1)) = g(f(x2)) -> x1 = x2 /* since f(x1) = f(x2) */
2. onto
forall y in Y
need to find x in X s.t. f(x) = y
let x = g(y)
f(x) = f(g(y)) = y

R ^ X = F(X, R) - {all functions from X to R}
for all x in X, pick up 1 element in R
so have |X| copies of R

relation
X, Y are 2 sets
R subset X times Y is called relation between X, Y
x R y <-> (x, y) in R

graph
G(f) = {(x, f(x)): x in X} subset X times Y
