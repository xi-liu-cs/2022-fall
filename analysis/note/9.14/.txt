real number
what is special about real
because real numbers are unique continuous number line on which we can do arithmetic

'continuous, completeness' = least upper bound property
'line' = ordered set
'arithmetic' = field

ordered sets
a binary relation on set A is a subset R subset A times A
containing pairs (a, b) in R where relation is said to hold
(a, b) in R <-> a R b
N, < := {(n, m) in N ^ 2 : n = m + p for some p in N}
(1, 3) in <
for n = 1, n + p = (1 + 2) = 3

ordered set s is a set s along with a binary relation
'<' which satisfies
(i) trichotomy property, given a, b in s, exactly 1 of x < y, x > y, or x = y holds
(ii) transitive property, given x, y, z in s, if x < y, y < z, then x < z

ex: N, Z, Q, R with < are ordered sets
S = {english words} with < as dictionary ordering
apple < dog < fox
apple < fox

counterex: A, S = {subset of A} = P(A)
X, Y subset A, (X, Y in S)
do not satisfy trichotomy
X = {0}
Y = {1}
X not subset Y
Y not subset X
X not = Y
so power set is not ordered set

let S be ordered set
(1) bounded above
E subset S be a nonempty subset
if exists b in S s.t. for all x in E, x <= b, then E is bounded above
and b is an upper bound of E

S = R, E = (0, 1) in S
2 in R, for all x in (0, 1), x <= 2, since 0 < x < 1 < 2
any b >= 1 is an upper bound of (0, 1)

set of english words E = {apple, dog}
zebra is an upper bound
bag is not upper bound

(2) bounded below
if exists b in S, s.t., for all x in E, x >= b
then we say E is bounded below, and b is a lower bound of E

(3) sup
an upper bound b0 of E is called the least upper bound or supremum of E
if for all upper bounds b of E, b0 <= b
sup E = b0

            lower bounds of E    b0 >= b   E in S    b0 <= b   upper bounds of E
<--------|--------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------->

(0, 1) in R
sup E = 1

(4) inf
lower bound b0 of E is called greatest lower bound or infimum of E
if for all b in {y in S: for all x in E, x >= y}, b0 >= b

lub property, dedekind completeness
an ordered set S has least upper bound property if every subset E subset S which is nonempty and bounded above
has a least upper bound (sup E exists)

Q does not have lub property
R does

sqrt{2} is irrational, sqrt{2} in R, sqrt{2} not in Q
E = {x in Q: x ^ 2 < 2}
is bounded above and non empty
sup E = sqrt{2}

field and ordered field axioms
ordered: arithmetic must be compatible with <
x < y and z in F, then x + z < y + z
x < 0, y < z, then xy > xz

Q, R are ordered fields
N, C are not

claim
C cannot be an ordered field
no way to assign ordering to C
make them a line
i in C, i ^ 2 = -1
suppose C is an ordered field, then
if i < 0: i * i > 0 * i
i ^ 2 > 0
-1 not > 0

if i not= 0

if i > 0: i * i > 0 * i
i ^ 2 > 0
-1 not > 0

lub vs glb
let F be an ordered field which has lub property
then if A subset F is non empty and bounded below
then A has a greatest lower bound
(i.e., F 'also has glb')

let A subset F be as given
b be any lower bound of A
define B = {-x in F: x in A} subset F
show that B is bounded above
first, show B is bounded above
b as lb, for all x in A, x >= b
since F is an ordered field, for all x in A, -x <= -b
-x in B
(i.e., for all y = -x in B, y <= b)
so (-b) is an ub of B, B is bounded above

by lub of F, B subset F has a lub
c := sup 'B
by def, for all y = -x in B
-x <= c
for all x in A, x >= -c

so, c is a lb of A
since c is lub of B, c <= (-b)

-c >= b
since -c is a lb of A, and -c >= b for any lb of A
-c is glb
so A has a glb

R characterization
exists an unique (up to isomorphism/bijection)
ordered field called R which contains Q and satisfies lub
R construction

let A = {x in R, x ^ 2 < 2} subset R
(1) r = sup A exists, and is unique positive real number
satisfying r ^ 2 = 2, write r = sqrt{2}
(2) r not in Q
Q proper subset R (sqrt{2} in R \ Q)
A cap Q = {x in Q: X ^ 2 < 2} subset Q does not have a lub in Q

squaring
r * r = r ^ 2 /* squaring arithmetic operation */
taking square root is not part of field axioms
construct square root from lub and arithmetic
