prove a ^ 2 = 2, then a is irrational
assume a is rational
a = m / n, gcd(m, n) = 1
m ^ 2 / n ^ 2 = 2
m ^ 2 = 2 n ^ 2, m ^ 2 is even

m = 2i + 1

m = 2k
4k ^ 2 = 2n ^ 2 -> n ^ 2 = 2k ^ 2
since m and n are both even
gcd(m, n) = 2, contradiction

pick h < (1 - s ^ 2) / (2s + 1) for the above inequality to hold
