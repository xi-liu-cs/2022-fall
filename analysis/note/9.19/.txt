let A = {x in R: x ^ 2 < 2}
1. r = sup A exists and B the unique positive real number satisfying r ^ 2 = 2, r = sqrt{2}
2. r not in Q

r ^ 2 = r * r
sqrt{x}

1. r = sup A exists using least upper bound property of R
2. r ^ 2 = 2 by proving r ^ 2 <= 2 and r ^ 2 >= 2
3. uniqueness: if s > 0 satisfy s ^ 2 = 2, uniqueness implies s = r

existence
1. 1 in R, 1 ^ 2 -> 1 in A -> A is non-empty
2. 3 in R, 3 ^ 2 = 9
if x in R satisfies x >= 3 -> x ^ 2 >= 9
if x ^ 2 < 9 -> x < 3 /* contrapositive */
x ^ 2 < 2 -> x ^ 2 < 9
if x in A, then x < 3
so 3 is an upper bound of A

so A is non-empty and bounded above
so by least upper bound property of R
r = sup A exists

r ^ 2 >= 2
suppose s > 0 satisfies s ^ 2 < 2 /* negation of r ^ 2 >= 2 */
show exists h > 0 s.t. (s + h) ^ 2 > 2 -> s + h in A but s + h > s, so s cannot be an upper bound
1. since 2 - s ^ 2 > 0, 2s + 1 > 0, (2 - s ^ 2) / (2s + 1) > 0
pick h > 0 to satisfy h < 1 and h < (2 - s ^ 2) / (2s + 1)
(s + h) ^ 2 - s ^ 2 = 2sh + h ^ 2 = (2s + h)h
< (2s + 1)h /* h < 1 */
< (2s + 1)(2 - s ^ 2) / (2s + 1) /* h < (2 - s ^ 2) / (2s + 1) */
= 2 - s ^ 2
rearrange
(s + h) ^ 2 < 2 -> s + h in A, so s cannot be an upper bound of A
so it is shown s ^ 2 < 2 -> s cannot be upper bound of A
take contrapositive, since r is an upper bound -> r ^ 2 >= 2

r ^ 2 <= 2
suppose s > 0 satisfies s ^ 2 > 2
show exists h > 0 s.t. s - h is an upper bound of A
since s ^ 2 - 2 > 0, h := (s ^ 2 - 2) / (2s) > 0
s ^ 2 - (s - h) ^ 2
= 2sh - h ^ 2 /* h > 0 */
< 2sh
= 2s((s ^ 2 - 2) / (2s)) = s ^ 2 - 2
rearrange
(s - h) ^ 2 > 2
let x in R, if x >= s - h > 0
then x ^ 2 > (s - h) ^ 2 > 2
by contrapositive,  x ^ 2 < 2 -> x < s - h
so s - h is upper bound of A
so if r ^ 2 > 2
it would not be least upper bound
thus r ^ 2 <= 2

combine r ^ 2 <= 2 and r ^ 2 >= 2 -> r ^ 2 = 2

uniqueness
suppose s > 0 satisfies s ^ 2 = 2
if s < r, since 0 < s, r
s ^ 2 < rs < r ^ 2
which is a contradiction
(assumed r ^ 2 = s ^ 2 = 2)
if r < s, since 0 < s, r
r ^ 2 < rs < s ^ 2
which is a contradiction
(assumed r ^ 2 = s ^ 2 = 2)
thus r = s

corollary Q does not have least upper bound property

archimedean property of R
suppose x, y in R satisfying x > 0
then exists n in N s.t. nx > y (*)
corollary: Q are dense in R
if x, y in R satisfying x < y, exists rational number satisfying x < r < y

infinity and dx (infinitesimal) are not real number /* plugging in infinity is not legal */
if infinity in R, pick y = infinity, x = 1, however, there is no natural number n
s.t. n * 1 > infinity

hyperreal numbers

archimedean property proof
suppose x, y in R are as given can divide (*) by x > 0 to get
n > y / x = t
archimedean property is equivalent to showing for all t in R
exists n in N, s.t. n > t, equivalent to showing natural numbers N are unbounded above

assume n in N are bounded above
by lub prop of R
exists r = sup N
r - 1 cannot be an upper bound of N -> exists n in N, s.t. n > r - 1
n + 1 > r but n + 1 in N, so b cannot be an upper bound
contradiction, thus N cannot be bounded above
so, exists n in N, s.t. nx > y

inf{1 / n: n in N} = 0
let A = {1 / n: n in N}
i / n > 0 for all n in N, so 0 is lb of A
inf A = b exists and b >= 0

suppose b > 0
by archimedean property, exists n in N
n * b > 1 -> b > 1 / n
contradicts b being a lower bound
so b <= 0

combine b = 0

A, -A = {-x in R, x in A}
inf A = sup(-A)

if sup A in A, say A has a maximum, and write max A := sup A
if inf A in A, say A has a minimum, and write min A := inf A

sup(0, 1) = 1 not in (0, 1)
sup{0, 1, 2} = 2 in {0, 1, 2}
max{0, 1, 2} = 2

x in R, abs(x)
|x| = 
{
  x if x >= 0
  -x if x < 0
}

|x| <= y iff -y < x < y
-|x| <= x <= |x| for all x in R

triangle inequality
x, y in R
|x + y| <= |x| + |y|
length of 3rd side of triangle is less then sum of length of other 2 sides
||vec(x) + vec(y)|| <= ||vec(x)|| + ||vec(y)||

given x, y in R
-|x| <= x <= |x| and -|y| <= y <= |y|
add left <= add mid <= add right
-(|x| + |y|) <= x + y <= |x| + |y|
-a <= b <= a
|x + y| <= |x| + |y|
|b| <= a

reverse triangle inequality
||x| - |y|| <= |x - y| (<= |x| + |-y| = |x| + |y|)
