given f: D -> R
f is bounded if exists B in R, s.t. |f(x)| <= B for all x in D
for all f(x) in f(D)
-B <= f(x) <= B
Ran(f) is bounded above as a set
if f D -> R is bounded (assume D is non-empty)
sup_{x in D} f(x) = sup f(D)
inf_{x in D} f(x) = inf f(D)

f:[-1, 1] -> R, f(x) = x ^ 2
f is bounded, |f(x)| <= 2, forall x in D

a sequence of real numbers is a function x: N -> R
x_n := x(n)
denote entire sequence by
{x_n}_{n = 1} ^ {infty}
or {x_n}

sequence is bouneded
1. if exists B in R s.t. |x_n| <= B forall n in N
2. if {x_n in R: n in N} = Ran(x) is bounded
3. if x is bounded as a function

{1 / n}_{n = 1} ^ {infty} = {1 / n} = 1 / 1, 1 / 2, 1 / 3, 1 / 4
!= {1 / n: n in N}

sequence have particular ordering of elements
set do not

{1}_{n = 1} ^ {infty} = 1, 1, ... (constant)
a in R, {ak}_{k = 1} ^ {infty} = a, 2a, ...

a sequence {x_n} of real numbers converges to some real number L in R
if for all epsilon > 0, exists M in N s.t.
|x_n - L| < epsilon for all n >= M

x_n converges to L means for all epsilon > 0 (1), exists M in N (2), for all n >= M (3), |x_n - L| < epsilon (4)
{x_n} is convergent to limit L
lim_{n -> infty} x_n := L

if sequence do not converge to any L in R
sequence is divergent

{1}_{n = 1} ^ {infty} = {x_n} converge to 1 (0)
let epsilon > 0 be arbitrary, (1)
take M = 1 in N (2)
for all n >= M = 1 (3)
|x_n - L| = |1 - 1| = 0 < epsilon (4)

{x_n} = {(-1) ^ n} = -1, 1, -1, 1, ...
claim: {x_n} is divergent
proof by contradiction: assume exists L in R s.t. {x_n} converges to L
for epsilon = 1 / 2 > 0
exists M in N, for all n >= M
|x_n - L| < epsilon = 1 / 2
/* ex: if put L = 0, |x_n - L| = |1 - 1 / 2| not< epsilon = 1 / 2 */
for even n >= M
|x_n - L| = |(-1) ^ n - L| = |1 - L| < epsilon = 1 / 2
|x_{n + 1} - L| = |-1 - L| < epsilon = 1 / 2
2 = |1 + 1 + L - L| = |(1 + L) + (1 - L)| <= |1 + L| + |1 - L| /* triangle inequality */
< epsilon + epsilon = 2 epsilon = 1
contradiction, {x_n} cannot converge, {x_n} diverge

visualize convergence definition
lim_{n -> infty} x_n = L
for all epsilon > 0 (1), exists M in N (2), for all n >= M (3), |x_n - L| < epsilon (4)
plot x vs x_n for {1 / n}, x is horizontal axis, x_n is vertical axis, guess x_n -> 0 as n -> infty
epsilon is accuracy, how accurate our L approximate x_n
finite epsilon, so finite accuracy

{x_n} = {1 / n}
claim: lim_{n -> infty} 1 / n = 0
proof: let epsilon > 0 be arbitrary (1)
by archimedean prop, exists M in N s.t.  
rx > y
M epsilon > 1
1 / M < epsilon (2)
for all n >= M (3)
|x_n - L| = |1 / n - 0| = 1 / n <= 1 / M (4)
lim_{n -> infty} 1 / n = 0

prop: a convergent sequence is bounded
corrollary: contrapositive: an unbounded sequence is divergent
bounded not-> convergent, ex: {(-1) ^ n} bounded divergent
proof: direct
aassume {x_n} is sequence that converges to L in R
for epsilon = 1 > 0 (1)
exists M in N, (2)
forall n >= M (3)
|x_n - L| < 1 = epsilon (4)
|x_n| = |x_n - L + L| <= |x_n - L| + |L| < 1 + |L| = B1
B2 := max{|x_1|, |x_2|, ..., |x_{n + 1}|}
take B = max{B1, B2}, for all n in N
|x_n| <= B
(n >= M, |x_n| <= B1 <= B)
(n < M, |x_n| <= B2 <= B)
{x_n} is bounded

limit of convergent sequence is unique
let x, y in R s.t. {x_n} converges to x and to y
want to show -> x = y
'give yourself an epsilon of room'
given x in R, if x <= epsilon for all epsilon > 0, then x <= 0
pf: contradiction
let x <= epsilon, for all epsilon > 0
assume x > 0 
0 < x / 2 < x
exists epsilon = x / 2 > 0
contradiction
x <= 0
