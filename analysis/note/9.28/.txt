monotone sequences
a sequence {x_n} is monotone increasing if
for all n in N, x_n <= x_{n + 1}
if x_n < x_{n + 1}, {x_n} is strictly monotone increasing

{1 / n}
1 / n > 1 / (n + 1)
{1 / n} is strictly monotone increasing

a monotone sequence {x_n} is convergent iff
it is bounded

monotone and convergent -> bounded, already proved
monotone sequence and bounded -> convergent
consider {x_n} is monotone increasing and bounded
exists B in R, |x_n| <= B for all n in N
{x_n, n in N} is bounded

x = sup{x_n, n in N} exists
let e > 0 be arbitrary
from hw1, for all e > 0, exists x_n in {x_n, n in N}, x - e < x_m < x
exists elements arbitrary close to x in {x_n, n in N}

since {x_n} is monotone increasing
for all n >= M, since {x_n} is monotone increasing
x + e > x >= x_n > x_{n - 1} >= ... > x - e
-e < x_n - x < e
|x_n - x| < e

conclude {x_n} is convergent
lim_{n -> inf}
= sup{x_n, n in N}

monotone decreasing
lim_{n -> inf}
= inf{x_n, n in N}

{1 / n}
by monotone convergent theorem
1 > 1 / n > 0
|1 / n| < 1
sequence is bounded
by mct, lim 1 / n = inf{1 / n, n in N} = 0

subsequences tails
given a sequence {x_n}_1 ^ {infty}
call a sequence {x_n_i}_{i = 1} ^ {infty}
is a subsequence if {n_i}_{i = 1} ^ {infty}
is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers

{x_n} = {n ^ 2}
{(2i) ^ 2}_{i = 1} ^ {infty} is a subsequence

{x_n} = {1 / n}
{1 / 2 ^ n} is a subsequence

{1 / 2 ^ i}_{i = 1} ^ {infty}
{n_i} = {2 ^ i}_{i = 1} ^ {infty}

subsequences limit = original sequence limit
let {x_n} be a convergent sequence, {x_n_i} be a subsequence
of this convergent sequence
then {x_n_i}_{i = 1} ^ {infty}
is convergent with lim_{i -> infty} x_n_i = lim_{n -> infty} x_n

lim 1 / (2 ^ n) = lim 1 / n = 0
if {n_i} is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers
then n_i >= i
{n_i} = 2, 4, 8
i = 1, 2, 3

let e > 0 be arbitrary
since {x_n} is convergnet to some x in R
exists m in N, for all n >= M, |x_n - x| < e
since n_i >= i for all i in N
for all i >= M, (n_i >= i >= M)
|x_n_i - x| < e

{x_n_i} is convergent, lim_{i -> inf} x_n_i = lim_{n -> inf} x_n
{y_i} = {x_n_i}

the k tail of a sequence {x_n} for k in N is subsequence
sequence of indices

4 tail of {1 / n}
is sequence {1 / (n + 4)}
{1 / n} = 1 / 1, 1 / 2, 1 / 3, ...
{1 / (n + 4)} = 1 / 5, 1 / 6, 1 / 7, ...

tails control convergence
given a sequence {x_n}, the following are equivalent, 1 <-> 2 <-> 3
1. {x_n} is convergent
2. k tail {x_{n + k}} is convergent for all k in N
3. k tail {x_{n + k}} is convergent for some k in N
lim_{n -> inf} x_n = lim_{n -> inf} x_{n + k} if {x_n} converges

the following are equivalent
proof strategy: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1

let x_n :=
{
  ..., n <= i
  1 / n, n > i
}
pick k = i
i-tail {x_n} is {1 / (n + i)}
converges
{x_n} satisfies (iii)

get
1. {x_n} converges
2. {x_{n + i}} converges for all i in N

1 -> 2
assume {x_n} is convergent
then, since {x_{n + k}} is a subsequence, {x_{n + k}} is convergent
lim_{n -> inf} x_{n + k} = lim_{n -> inf} x_n

2 -> 3
if {x_{n + k}} is convergent for all k in N
... some k in N

3 -> 1
assume {x_{n + k}} converges for some k in N

let e > 0 be arbitrary
exists M in N, forall n >= M, |x_{n + k| - x| < e
x := lim x_{n + k}
for all n >= M + k
|x_n - x| < e

ratio test
prop
let c > 0
1. if c < 1, {c ^ n} is convergent, lim_{n -> inf} c ^ n = 0
2. if c > 1, {c ^ n} is unbounded, hence divergent

ex: (0.4) ^ n -> 0
(4) ^ n divergent

prove {c ^ n} converges, c < 1
c > 0 -> c ^ n > 0, for all n in N
c < 1 -> c ^ {n + 1} = c c ^ n < c ^ n for all n in N
|c ^ n| <= 1, c ^ {n + 1} < c ^ n
mct, {c ^ n} is monotone and bounded, hence convergent

lim c ^ n = 0
l := lim c ^ n
1 tail of c ^ n is {c ^ {n + 1}} = {c * c ^ n}
{c}, {c ^ n} are convergent, also have 1 tail {c ^ {n + 1}} also converges to l

l = lim c ^ {n + 1}
= lim c (c ^ n)
= (lim c)(lim c ^ n)
= cl

l - cl = 0
l(1 - c) = 0
c < 1
so 1 - c != 0
so l = 0
