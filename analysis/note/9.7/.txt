f(x) = (e ^ {7x} + ln(pi(x + 1))) / (sqrt(3)(x ^ 2 + 6))
is f differentiable, yes, (product, chain)
int_0 ^ 1 f(x) dx, does this average value exist, yes
F(x) = int_0 ^ x f(x) dx, does it exist

brownian motion (weiner process)
position vs time graph of a particle
randomly jostled around
f(t) no formula
draw a secant line between 2 points, zoom in
fractal nature, f'(t) does not exist

proof based, start with formal definitions
a set A is an object containing members or elements

set of all possible elements under consideration is called universe
typically, universe is real numbers
set with not members is empty or null set

set builder notation
a predicate is a statement which is either true or false, depending on value
of 1 or more variables
p(x){return x <= 3}
S = {E(x): P(x)} /* E is expression */

(-inf, 3] = {x: x <= 3}
even = {2n: n in N}
A = {x in S: P(x)} /* S is domain = universe */

natural number: N = {1, 2, 3, ...}
integer: Z = {0, -1, 1, -2, 2}
rational: Q = {m / n: m, n in Z, n != 0}
real number: R

set algebra
binary
given 2 sets A, B
symbolic := logical
A cup B = {x: x in A or x in B}
A cap B = {x: x in A and x in B}
complement of B relative to A
A \ B = {x: x in and x not in B}
if A is universe or some implied set
B ^ c = A \ B /* R \ B */
irrational: R \ Q

A, B are disjoint if A cap B = null
P = set of primes
P ^ C = N \ P

set relation
A subset B if x in A implies x in B
null subset A for any set A, vacuously true

A = B if A subset B and B subset A
x <= y, y <= x implies x = y
A = B
1. x in A -> x in B
2. x in B -> x in A
x in A iff x in B

if A subset B and A != B, A is proper subset of B

demorgan's law
A \ (B cup C) = (A \ B) cap (A \ C)
A \ (B cap C) = (A \ B) cup (A \ C)
(B cup C) ^ C = (B ^ C) cap (C ^ C)
(B cap C) ^ C = (B ^ C) cup (C ^ C)
