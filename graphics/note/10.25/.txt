gl.drawArrays(GLenum mode)
mode:
gl.TRANGLE_STRIP, more efficient
gl.TRIANGLES more general, disconnected

also add color to each vertex
reduce draw calls
vertex shader linearly interpolate uv value in between vertices

u,v is a lookup into a place in source image
under sampling
many parts of the image

take integral, average of sum of all values
aliasing
high frequency phenomena

2 high frequency signals that we cannot hear interfere with each other to create what we can hear

forward kinematics
inverse kinematics
all possible positions for an elbow is on an sphere centered at the shoulder
