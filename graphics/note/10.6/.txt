represent cube as 12 triangles
fragment shader only do work when there are triangles
color closer z value if 2 triangles are stacked onto each other
keep a buffer internally
z buffer
map u v to x y z
parametric surfaces
triangle strip: only 1 vertex added per triangle
turn 2d strip
glue triangle strip together
allow to make a degenerate triangle, that have 0 area
so they are not displayed

mesh a, b
a = [], b = []
replicate a.back, b.front
a_0 ... a_{n -1} a_{n - 1} b_0 b_0 ... b_{n - 1}

every time render a mesh
need to have a draw call
combine into a single mesh, become a single draw call

a vertex represented by 8 numbers [x, y, z, n_x, n_y, n_z, u, v]
based on 3 vertices, look at 3 edges, 3 vectors
cross product
find the direction where triangle face
step 1:
compute cross product between any 2 pairs of edges
add 3 vectors together
step 2:
compute same thing for each triangle
add all surrounding triangle for a point's direction
