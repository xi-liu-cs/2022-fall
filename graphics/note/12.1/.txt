marching tetrahedra
paths: 6 diff ways
texture mapping
use features that is protected by the browser
image is sitting on server
browser protect files on client
call draw_mesh(texture_source)
only load file once
have a texture object that store list of known textures
s.textures = {}
uniform sampler2D u_sampler /* index of which texture to be sampled */
image.onload = function(){} /* load on a another parallel thread, function() is what to do when image is loaded */
'this' is the image
when image is close, do gl.linear interpolation
when image is far away, do gl.linear mipmap nearest

dancing points under sampling
mipmap: approximate integral

source image dimensions are powers of 2

technique from vision
take n * n image
create anther image from it to be n / 2 * n / 2

3 interpolations per square
1 interpolation between 2 square

very few algorithms survive since performance is not good although more accurate
