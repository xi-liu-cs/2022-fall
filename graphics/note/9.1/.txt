convolutional neural network in nvidia gpu
model -> render -> image
5g: 3 billion bits / second
vr smaller if computation done to another big computer, transfer data through network
vr wired to nvidia board
break object into polygons, parallelizable
pass vertex data to vertex shader, figure out which pixel triangle covers, pass to fragment shader
spline: smooth surface, curve
no 3.js, where entire graphics course is done for you, use provided code
