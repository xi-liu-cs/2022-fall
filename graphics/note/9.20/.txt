phong shading
highlight
diffused
if dot product between L and N
length of both are 1, so cos of angle between them
query rays
for each light source
if did not hit sphere, t = -1
if hit sphere, t > 0
pipelined processor
cpu is all about flexibility
1. what is uDc, uniform diffuse color
2. why look homework file different for different systems, some uninitialized variable
3. #include in glsl, concatenate strings
if statement can cause branch divergence
an if statement is about 75 machine instructions
if there is an if statement for each pixel, them it slows down
const int idx;
a loop is a macro, replicating instructions 1 after another
how to avoid if:
float weight = step(t, 0.)
webxr
opengl have compute shaders
