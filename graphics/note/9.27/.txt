represent a point P as a column vector
x

w

a plane A as a row vector
a b c d

point P is on plane A if dot product A dot P is 0
ax + by + cz + dw = 0

homogeneous means 1 side is 0
can scale 1 side without worrying about worrying about another side

unit cube
-1 <= x, y, z <= 1

-1 <= x
homogeneous (must be <= 0 at right side): -x - 1 <= 0
matrix row: -1 0 0 -1 /* (a, b, c, d) */
if take a point (x, y, z, 1) and plug in to these 6 equations, if we get a value <= 1 for all of them, point is within cube

ray: V + tW
solve for what point along ray is on plane
V = [Vx, Vy, Vz]
W = [Wx, Wy, Wz]
[x, y, z] = [Vx + tWx, Vy + tWy, Vz + tWz]
given halfspace
ax + by + cz + dw <= 0
a(Vx + tWx) + b(Vy + tWy) + c(Vz + tWz) + d(Vw + tWw) <= 0
aVx + bVy + cVz + dVw +
aWx + bWy + cWz + dWw <= 0
AV + tAW <= 0
tAW <= -AV
t <= -AV / AW

each of A dot V or A dot W can be <, >, or =, so 9 cases total
if AV < 0, already inside halfspace
if AW < 0, direction toward inside halfspace, moving further in

t_{enter} <= t_{exit}, ray intersects cude
t_{enter} > t_{exit}, ray misses cube
