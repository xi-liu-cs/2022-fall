image is array of pixels
alpha is transparency, [0, 1], opaque when alpha = 1
antialiasing
r, g, b, a in [0, 255] /* 8 bits, each pixel 32 bit word */
across each octave, frequency change by factor of 2
gamma correction:
[0, 255] image pixel values are stored with a power law
128 represents 0.25 brightness
187 represents 0.50 brightness
sqrt([r, g, b])
html canvas
vertex: where to place triangle
fragment: fill color of pixel

!$ is the "end" of the previous command
cursor, time is uniform (u), do not change over pixels
position, varying (v), change over pixels
