ml theory to algo, shai, 302, perceptron
y = sign(w ^ t, x) not differentiable
use a differentiable function instead

surprisal negative log likelihood
mnist database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database)
is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems

x -> image
y -> {0, 1, ..., 9}
x is very large, huge vector of inputs

learn a model on a featurized image
histogram of oriented gradients
amount of weight is a lot smaller

bias allow output to be reasonable
each neuron have a connection to previous layer
