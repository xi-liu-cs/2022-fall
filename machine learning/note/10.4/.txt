row = predicted vs col = ground truth
confusion matrix 混淆矩阵

precision = tp / (tp + fp) = (true positive) / (true positive + false positive)
recall = tp / (tp + fn) = (true positive) / (true positive + false negative)
if want to be true that a negative result is truely negative, need to use recall
specificity = tn / (tn + fp)

do not care about both examples equally
if a covid detector, if result is negative, must have high confidence that it is truely negative
so a lot of false positives in covid test
