unsupervised: no labels
principal component analysis: identify direction that maximize variance
k means clustering
1. distance measure
d(A, B)
a. euclidean distance, sqrt{dx ^ 2 + dy ^ 2}
b. manhattan distance, dx + dy
c. minkowski distance, sqrt{sum_i d_j ^ p}

k number of clusters
w = sum_{k = 1} ^ k 1 / |c_k| sum d_{ij}

for every pair i, j
find distance, sum them, divide by number of points

minimize cluster variation, points inside cluster are tight

for each of k clusters, compute centroid 几何中心
kth cluster centroid is vector of feature averages for observations in cluster k

assign each observation to cluster whose centroid is closest
