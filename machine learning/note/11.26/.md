The first part of the project is to simulate main memory. In this simulated system,
data is written to and read from the main memory as entire 8-word cache lines, not individual
words (which are 32 bits).
The second part of the project is to simulate a direct-mapped, write-back L2 cache. As with
the main memory part that you have already completed, in this simulated system data is written
to and read from the L2 cache as entire 8-word cache lines, not individual words (which are 32
bits).
The third part of the project is to simulate a 4-way set associative, write-back L1 cache.
Unlike the main memory and L2 cache that you have already completed, data is read from and
written to the L1 cache (by the CPU) one 32-bit word at a time. Following an L1 cache miss,
however, an entire 8-word cache line is inserted into the L1 cache.
The fourth and last part of the memory subsystem phase of the project is to implement a
simulated controller for the memory subsystem. This controller manages the movement of
data among the CPU, the L1 cache, the L2 cache, and main memory.
