what can we learn from human brain
inspiration from nature
human want to fly
wright brothers came up with a machine that can fly
different from how a bird fly
emulate aspects of mind onto machines
relationship between mind and body
dualism:
mind and body are distinct and non-identical entities
monism:
mind and body are manifestations of a single substance

from outside observer, only physical properties can be observed
mental properties cannot be observed
only creater of machine know whether it has a mind or not
other people is would not know how computations in machine are done
1791 galvani: electricity applied to nerves could make muscles move
over time, better measuring tools, better understand how brains work
which inform better machine learning algorithms

brain is an organism that have nerves in it
view brain as computational engine
input: eyes: when seeing image
that input go through computations
output: motor control systems (move hand up and down)

mind probably has other forms of computing mechanism that is different than the computer has
mind acquire different architecture than computer
recreate the way brain work on an actual system

when see a bird fly, you see that it is feasible (bird can fly)
so that can try to recreate
david marr's 3 levels of analysis
vision is information processing task
1. computational level: what does system do. what problems does it solve, why does it do these things
2. algorithmic level: how does system do what it does, what representations does it use
3. implementation, physical level: how is system physically realized

bird fly:
computation = flight
algorithm = flapping
physical = feathers, circuit in bird's brain

algorithmic level is more important than physical level
implementation level of human is harder to transfer from biological system (chemical reactions in neurons) to machine

experiment
anesthetize cat, put electrode in cat's brain
receptive field to stimuli

human memory is related form of consciousness
consciousness is affecting what memory
procedural memory

take inspirations from other entities other than machines
