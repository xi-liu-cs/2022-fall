what can we learn from human brain
inspiration from nature
human want to fly
wright brothers came up with a machine that can fly
mechanism of how planes fly is different from how a bird fly
feathers vs wings
not emulated flapping or feathers

maybe 1 way to create machine learning algorithms is figure out
how the mind works
an entity mind that is telling body how to move
body itself is giving mind a signal
mind does not operate in ether, it obtains sensory signals from body

emulate aspects of mind onto machines
relationship between mind and body
dualism:
mind and body are distinct and non-identical entities
monism:
mind and body are manifestations of a single substance

dualism:
physical properties: public, visual, audio, motion through space and time, can be measured
mental properties: private, consciousness, intentionality (belief, desire, idea), cannot know what others are thinking

from outside observer, only physical properties can be observed
mental properties cannot be observed

can a machine have a mind?
if put a computer inside a robot, can see robot move, but cannot see what machine is thinking about
unclear whether machine has a mind

only creater of machine know whether it has a mind or not, consciousness, intentionality
other people is would not know how internal computations in machine are done

relationship between mind and brain
brain can be measured
by understanding how brain works at a physical level
we can emulate algorithms and computations onto a machine

170 bc galen: seat of complex thought
1791 galvani: electricity applied to nerves could make muscles move
1963 hodgkin: nobel prize for showing how neurons communicate
via electrical and chemical signalling
over time, better measuring tools, better understand how brains work
which inform better machine learning algorithms

brain is an organism that have nerves in it
view brain as computational engine
input: eyes: when seeing image
that input go through computations
output: motor control systems (move hand up and down)

input (perceptual systems) -> memory -> practical reasoning -> output (motor control systems)

mind probably has other forms of computing mechanism that is different than the computer has
mind acquire different architecture than computer
recreate the way brain work on an actual system

when see a bird fly, you see that it is feasible (bird can fly)
so that can try to recreate
david marr's 3 levels of analysis
vision is information processing task
1. computational level: what does system do. what problems does it solve, why does it do these things
2. algorithmic level: how does system do what it does, what representations does it use
(what processes does it employ to build and manipulate representations)
3. implementation, physical level: how is system physically realized (what neural structures and neuronal activities
implement visual system)

bird fly:
computation = flight
algorithm = flapping
physical = feathers, circuit in bird's brain

do not take inspiration from implementation level as much, computation level matter most, and then algorithm level
algorithmic level is more important than physical level
implementation level of human is harder to transfer from biological system (chemical reactions in neurons) to machine

answering questions such as what is the human doing is more important than questions such as what is the
chemical communication of neurons needed to make that happen
because implementation level is hard to transfer from humans or biological system to machine
computational or algorithmic level is easier to transfer

what is architecture used in brain
experiment
anesthetize cat, put electrode in cat's brain
each neuron is receptive field to stimuli
what 1 neuron says is related to what a nearby neuron is saying
fukushima 1980, make a copy of a cat's brain on a computer
map from a cat's brain to an artificial neural network

human memory is related form of consciousness
way in which we are consciously thinking about the world affects what type of memory system is being used
for that type of consciousness
procedural memory: doing a motor task over and over again
priming: higher probability of recognizing previously perceived information
perceptual: understanding context of stimulus
semantic memory: general context free facts, equations
episodic memory: what you experienced from past
consciousness is affecting what memory
procedural memory
take inspirations from other entities other than machines (from systems that already work)
brain is modular and has attention in it
specific parts of brain for specific task, linked
