a packet starts in a host (source), passes through a series
of routers, and arrives in another host (destination)
as a packet travels from one node (host or router) to the subsequent node (host or router)
along this path, the packet suffers from several types of delays at each node along the path
a packet can be transmitted on a link only if there is no other packet
currently being transmittedd on link and if there are no other packets preceding it in the queue

64
processing delay: time required to examine the packet’s header and determine where to direct the
packet is part of the processing delay
queuing delay: at the queue, the packet experiences a queuing delay as it waits to be transmitted onto
the link. length of the queuing delay of a specific packet will depend on the number of earlier-arriving packets that are queued and waiting for transmission onto the link. if queue empty, packet's queuing delay is 0
transmission delay: assume our packet can be transmitted in first come first served manner
our packet can be transmitted after all packets arrived before it have been transmitted
l = packet length (bits)
r = transmission rate of link from a to b (bits / sec)
transmission delay = l / r
propagation delay: once a bit is pushed into the link, it needs to propagate to router b.
time required to propagate from the beginning of the link to router b is the propagation
delay. bit propagates at the propagation speed of the link. propagation
speed depends on the physical medium of the link (that is, fiber optics, twisted-pair
copper wire, and so on) and is in the range of
2 * 10 ^ 8 meters / sec to 3 * 10 ^ 8 meters / sec
which is equal to, or a little less than, the speed of light

66
d_{nodal} = d_{proc} + d_{queue} + d_{trans} + d_{prop}
d_{prop} is hundreds of milliseconds for two routers 
interconnected by a geostationary satellite link, and can be dominant term in d_{nodal}

67
a = average rate at which packets arrive at queue (packets / sec)
r = transmission rate (bits / sec)
l = size of each packet (bits)
l * a bits / sec = average rate at which bits arrive at queue
l * a / r = traffic intensity, estimate extent of queuing delay
if l * a / r > 1, then the average rate at which bits arrive at
the queue exceeds the rate at which the bits can be transmitted from the queue

69
n - 1 routers from source to destination
d_{end - end} = n(d_{proc} + d_{trans} + d_{prop})
d_{trans} = l / r
r = transmission rate (bits / sec)
l = size of each packet (bits)
