address space is divided into pages
a byte is smallest data type
based on how many char
virtual address space: 2 ^ 64
page: 2 ^ 12
#page = 2 ^ 64 / 2 ^ 12 = 2 ^ 52
2 different processes will always go to different physical pages
in what scenario does the os map 2 different virtual pages to a same physical page?
dynamically linked libraries
not whole program of zoom is currently in memory, some error handling part would be loaded when needed
some pages of zoom in disk
valid bit: 0 means page is not in memory
