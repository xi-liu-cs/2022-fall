translate from virtual page number to physical page number
but virtual page offset does not change
left 12 bits for virtual page number, right bits for offset
smaller memory can hold fewer pages, so more page faults
load or store, anything has parenthesis, memory access, generate virtual address
lw (%rax), %rbx, load word, a memory access, generate virtual address used by mmu
add %rax, %rbx, to get instruction itself, need to access memory

so 2 memory access
1. to get instruction itself, add, load, ..., in code section
2. parenthetical memory access in instructions, lw (%rax), %rbx

tlb: some pages are heavily referenced

trip
1. cpu (va)
2. mmu (vpn)
3. tlb (pte)
4. mmu (pa)
5. memory
6. cpu (data)
