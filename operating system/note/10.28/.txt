when kick out a page
overwrite it or write it back to disk

hardware maintains a matrix of n * n bits
can put in mmu, hard for multicore
so put in in memory, or a specialized hardware inside chip outside all cpus

hardware
least recently used
machine with n page frames
hardware maintains a matrix of n * n bits
matrix initialized to all 0s
if page k is referenced
set all bits of row k to 1
set all bits of column k to 0
row with lowest value is lru

software
not frequently used
software counter with each page
at each clock interrupt, os scans all pages and add r bit of each page to counter of that page
at page fault, page with lowest counter is replaced

better to put counter in page table entry rather than hardware
page fault frequency: tells when to increase/decrease page allocation for a process
