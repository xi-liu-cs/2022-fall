cpu is not connected to disk
cpu is connected to memory
cpu cannot execute anything that does not exist in memory
processes must exist in memory, not in disk
active processes need to be able to be swapped in
and out of main memory in order in maximize processor utilization
modules are what processes are in the memory

base: start address of program in physical memory
limit (bound): length of program

for every memory access (load or store)
base is added to address
result compared to limit
memory management unit

if machine is slow, does not necessarily mean cpu is slow
it might mean memory is small, not many processes are swept in the disk, moving from disk to memory is slow

programs move in and out of memory
if a hole is adjacent to process, allocated to it
process moved to bigger hole
process suspended till enough memory is there

worst fit: when pick biggest empty space
leftover big enough to be useful for some other processes
