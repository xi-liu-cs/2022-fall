potential deadlock

process_a()
{
  lock(m1)
  lock(m2)
}

process_b()
{
  lock(m2)
  lock(m1)
}

more deadlock
threads from different processes

square r to circle a
process a is holding resource r

circle b to square s
process b is requesting resource s

there is an actual deadlock if there is a circular chain

allocation matrix
request matrix
