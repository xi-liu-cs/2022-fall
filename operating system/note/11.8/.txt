user (m), kernel (n) level threads 
m >= n
difference between fork and pthread_create
after fork, parent process continue until end
after pthread_create, thread stop until the start_routine end
so call another function inside start_routine
pthread_join, block until thread p1 finish

(always first) main begin
{which finish is not determined: 
a
b}
(always last) main end

++counter:
suppose reg0 stores the memory address mem of counter
mov (reg0), reg1 /* read */
add $1, reg1 /* modify */
mov reg1, (reg0) /* write */

suppose reg0, reg0.2 stores the memory address mem of counter
thread 1                                thread 2
mov (reg0), reg1 /* read */             mov (reg0.2), reg1.2 /* read */ 
add $1, reg1 /* modify */               add $1, reg1.2 /* modify */
mov reg1, (reg0) /* write */            mov reg1.2, (reg0.2) /* write */
then the memory address of reg0, reg0.2 stores 1, but should be 2
