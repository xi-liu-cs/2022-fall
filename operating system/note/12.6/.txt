self driving car
full of io devices, sensors
need to act very fast
real time decisions

io device
registers
status
command
data

device interaction
calling process to sleep
context switch
interrupt
wakes process that needed io

a number on bus to indicate which interrupt routine
array of pointers to functions
interrupt number that index into array of functions

interrupt controller
order the interrupts sent to cpu

if device is fast, poll is better
if device is slow, interrupt is better

direct memory access
transfers between devices and main memory without cpu intervention

each control register is assigned an io port number
io port is accessed with special instruction

peripheral component interconnect express

a layer of os maps symbolic device names onto proper drivers

device drivers
receive abstract read write from layer above and carry them out

sector = group of bytes
master boot record
